# FrontEnd

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Key Elements of Your Angular Project Structure

.angular and .vscode

These folders contain configuration files specific to Angular CLI tools and Visual Studio Code editor settings, respectively.
node_modules

This directory contains all the projectâ€™s npm dependencies. These are installed via npm and are defined in your package.json.
src

The source folder where your actual application code resides.
app - This is the core folder where most of your Angular components, services, and other Angular specific files like modules and routes are stored.
Each feature (like contact-form, menu, our-nursery, etc.) has its own folder, potentially with its own components, modules, and services.
assets - This folder contains static assets like images, fonts, and other files which are served directly.
environments - Contains configuration files for different environments like production or development.
Configuration Files

angular.json - Angular CLI configuration for your project.
package.json - Defines project dependencies and build scripts.
.gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
.editorconfig - Helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the project.
README.md - Markdown file providing information about the project, setup instructions, and other important details.
Core Application Files

index.html - The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your app.
main.ts - The main entry point for your application logic.
styles.css - Global styles for your application.
Best Practices
Component Organization

Keep components that are used throughout your app in shared modules, and feature-specific components within their respective feature folders.
Lazy Loading

Consider implementing lazy loading for feature modules to improve load times.
Service Layer

Keep services that interact with backend APIs in a separate services folder if they are shared across multiple components.
Environment Files

Use the environments folder to define environment-specific settings like API endpoints.
Testing

Keep your test files (*.spec.ts) next to the components they test for easy reference.
Documentation

Continuously update your README.md to reflect any changes in the project setup or to provide additional documentation.
Version Control

Regularly commit changes to your repository to maintain a history of changes and to facilitate collaboration with other developers.
